                For the purposes of this project, I am referring to the consumption of information, as
                opposed to the consumption of physical objects, such as food. Information consumption can be defined as:

                <br><br>
                "the sum of information and entertainment media taken in by an individual or group" (Shaulova)
                <br><br>

                Let's break that down. First and foremost, consumption can be both an individual activity, or a societal
                one. When an individual consumes information that comes from a discussion with their partner, the
                general public never has the opportunity to receive the information that was discussed. But, when an
                individual obtains information that comes from a news article or social media, a significant proportion
                of their
                community also has access to that information: therefore, making the consumption a societal activity.

                <br><br>

                In today's world, societal information consumption mostly occurs through everyone's favorite way to
                spend time: <b style="color: #34A0A4">the internet</b>.
                We consume information through mediums such as social media and review sites, such as Facebook,
                Instagram, Reddit, Yelp, or TikTok.

                <p style="width: 550px; background: #D9ED92; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px">

                    In today's world, reputation impacts our every action. Before doing anything, we attempt to
                    ascertain
                    its reputation by utilizing <b style="color: #34A0A4">the internet</b>. ReputationX, an online
                    Reputation Management
                    Service defines reputation as:

                    <br><br>
                    "Reputation is the subjective qualitative belief a person has regarding a brand, person, company,
                    product, or service"
                    <br><br>

                    Let's break this down again. First and foremost, reputation is <u>subjective.</u> It depends on the
                    person who is perceiving that reputation. In other words, a reputation is an opinion. Every person
                    can
                    have their own feelings on a topic, which is why reputation is a <i>belief</i>. But, belief isn't
                    always based on facts, making discussions involving varying beliefs potentially detrimental to
                    relationships. In fact, belief is such a powerful force that it elevates reputation's importance in
                    society.
                    <br><br>

                    Reputation is important. But why? In life, a favorable reputation gets us what we want:
                    friends, self-esteem, money, relationships, and happiness. In business, a business with a good
                    reputation makes greater profits.

                    <p style="width: 750px; background: #5fcf97; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px""><strong>How do we easily decide how good something is?</strong> We rank it.
                        NHL Teams?
                        Rankings. Colleges? Rankings. Intellect? Rankings.
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, ranking is the way our society works. Ranking is a classification system that
                        awards
                        points based on desirable categories. The higher the rank, the better the "thing." In athletics,
                        ranking systems are used to determine who is the best athlete: the fastest runner of the race is
                        ranked #1. The #1 rank immediately gives the runner the best reputation within the running
                        community. But, does this mean that runner is the "best runner?"
                        Well, the ranking of athletes is dependent on their speed, but there is significantly more that
                        goes into the criteria that makes a good runner. The runner who works the hardest may not be
                        ranked #1 because they aren't the fastest, but that doesn't mean they aren't as deserving of a
                        medal for their work.

                        <br><br>
                        Athletics is easier to determine ranking because there is one criterion for placement. In
                        running, the #1 rank simply goes to the person who runs the fastest. In hockey, the team that
                        scores the most goals is #1. But, in education ranking can become a little more difficult.
                        <br><br>

                        At Shenendehowa, we utilize class ranking to determine which individuals are the smartest. But,
                        nothing about the class ranking system is related to intellect. Class ranking is determined by
                        the best average, and the best average can be attained by taking less rigorous classes and
                        obtaining high grades. Since a student can obtain a high average by taking less rigorous
                        classes, the #1 class rank spot may not always be held by the student who is considered the
                        "smartest" in their grade. But then again, there are numerous criteria that define smartness.
                        The valedictorian is considered the best, and have the best reputation, but are they truly the
                        smartest of their class?

                        <br><br>

                        In business, the best company can be considered the one that makes the most profit, but does
                        that really mean they are "the best?" Since there are a plethora of factors that determine what
                        makes a company number one, the criteria become subjective: returning us to the discussion of
                        reputation. I may believe that the company that is the "best" is the one that aids the world the
                        most. I form this opinion based on the news articles I consume (no, I do not eat the articles),
                        and the information that is presented to me within them. If I see a statistic that SpaceX has
                        donated a large sum of money to aid refugees, SpaceX has the best reputation in my book.
                        But, another person may see a statistic that Amazon was the sole cause in the DOW Jones
                        Industrial Average being raised by 5 points, and deem Amazon the "best."

                        <br><br>
                        The consumption of reputation via ranking is an ineffective way to make decisions, because
                        ranking is subjective, and a list built by experts is still subject to their criteria, not mine.

                    <p style="width: 750px; background: #dce9fc; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px""><strong>Ranking is criteria based. Reviews are subjective.</strong> In a
                        review system, any individual who chooses to express their opinion may do so.

                        <br><br>

                        Take Yelp for example: "Yelp has 73 million unique monthly users on their mobile app, and over
                        100 million unique monthly users on their desktop site" (11 Yelp Statistics). Yelp is a service
                        in which crowd-sourced reviews are provided for the public, meaning that Yelp readers are able
                        to obtain reviews directly from users of products and services. In a 2011 Harvard Business
                        School Study, researchers found a strong correlation between Yelp Review averages and business
                        revenue. In Layman's terms, the higher rated a business is on Yelp, the more revenue it makes.
                        But, does this mean that the higher rated something is on Yelp, the better reputation it has?
                        From a community standpoint, yes! If a community believes that a business or product should be
                        highly rated, giving it a good reputation, that means it must be fantastic, right? <b
                                style="color: #34A0A4">Wrong.</b>
                        As is taught to any Statistics student, a review site obtains review from the positive end, and
                        the negative end of the spectrum. If a person feels very strongly that the restaurant they just
                        ate at was amazing, they will gladly rate it 5 stars. But, if another individual despises the
                        restaurant, they would also be willing to share their unpleasant experience on Yelp.

                        <br><br>
                        This same philosophy can be applied to Amazon reviews. While anyone can write an Amazon review,
                        many consumers are unlikely to spend time writing a product review if they are indifferent about
                        the product they bought. But, if a user absolutely loves the product they've bought, they are
                        more likely to take the time to provide a positive review. Very often, products have both
                        negative and positive reviews, but not many in between. This skews the average rating of a
                        project towards one end or the other of the spectrum, thus giving the product an inaccurate
                        reputation.
                        <br><br>


                        Is the consumption of reputation from a crowd-sourced site useful in making decisions? Once
                        again, I don't believe so. Only
                        obtaining opinions from the extreme end of the spectrum is an ineffective way to truly determine
                        the quality of something, and I therefore need to find my own strategy.

                        determining reputation based on consumption of information such as rankings or reviews isn't
                        effective.
                        <br><br>
                        While obtaining reviews can give an individual a sense for how other's see a product, making a
                        decision solely on society's opinions isn't the right choice for oneself. More often than not,
                        in order to ascertain the reputation or quality of a product or service, we ask those around us.
                        But, the paradigm shift I have developed after viewing the biases and discrepancies around
                        ranking systems and community based reviews is that I should be utilizing my own research prior
                        to anyone else's opinions.

            go to a university that will help me build the qualities NASA looks for in their astronauts. Most astronauts
            come from schools that are on the list of the top 30 colleges in the US. To me, I see the easiest path to
            space by following in the tracks of past astronauts. 3/10 of the most recent astronaut class from a pool of
            12,000 obtained graduate degrees from MIT, a simple statistic that represents the reputation of school that
            I’m
            drawn to. But, with a 4% acceptance rate, I know that no matter how hard I work there will always be
            applicants who are stronger than I am.

            For the past three years, I've been trying to instill myself with the values of an Ivy League student: a
            love for learning, desire to research, an unassailable work ethic. Along this journey, I've found myself
            losing a small portion of the fun-loving child I grew up as. When I was younger, I spent as much time as I
            could living in every moment with the understanding that every moment only occurs once. As the COVID-19
            pandemic began, I lost sight of that desire for fun. If there's one thing this project has taught me, it's
            that the top 30 colleges are considered prestigious by society, and are only prestigious if we choose them
            to be. When Cornell plays Union in Hockey, Cornell's status as an Ivy League college doesn't automatically
            mean it will win the game, but society views Cornell as an elite school, automatically disqualifying Colgate
            as having any chance at winning. To me, this means I need to stop viewing schools on a tier system of
            prestige, and see them for what they are: an opportunity for me to grow and learn.

            <br><br>
            I think this specifically means that I need to reconsider my options for college. My dream of being an
            astronaut shouldn't be the reason I choose a college, my dream should be the reason I work hard in college,
            no matter where I go. During my research process, I listened to a podcast from Malcolm Gladwell called
            "Revisionist History." One episode of this podcast discussed how schools such as Dillard University are
            equal in education quality to Harvard, but receive less attention simply because they are disregarded as
            less prestigious. This episode led me to question whether I want to attend college for the name on my
            certificate, or the number in my bank account afterwards. This question opened my eyes to all of my options
            for programs and schools that I had never even considered before, even the University of Toronto, which was
            the first school removed from my list as soon as my brother decided to go there. No matter where I choose to
            go to college, I being happy should be one of my criteria, not prestige.
